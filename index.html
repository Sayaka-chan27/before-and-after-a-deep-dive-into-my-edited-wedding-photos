            <p>Wedding photos are more than just pictures—they’re timeless memories that deserve to be preserved in the best possible way.

            <h2>The Importance of Editing in Wedding Photography</h2>
            <h3>Why Editing Matters</h3>
            <p>Even the best photographers can’t control every aspect of a wedding day. Lighting conditions, unexpected distractions, and other challenges can affect the final image. That’s where editing comes in. It allows us to correct imperfections, enhance colors, and highlight the emotions captured in each moment.</p>
            <h3>Common Editing Techniques</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Color correction to balance tones</li>
                <li>Skin retouching for a natural glow</li>
                <li>Background cleanup to remove distractions</li>
                <li>Adding cinematic effects for a timeless feel</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Before and After: Real Examples</h2>
            <h3>Example 1: The First Dance</h3>
            <p>The first dance is one of the most emotional moments of a wedding. In the raw photo, the lighting was uneven, and the background was cluttered. After editing, the lighting was balanced, the background distractions were removed, and the couple was brought into focus, creating a magical moment.</p>
            <h3>Example 2: Outdoor Ceremony</h3>
            <p>Outdoor ceremonies often come with harsh lighting and shadows. In this example, the raw photo had overexposed highlights and dull colors. The edited version brought out the vibrant colors of the flowers, softened the shadows, and added warmth to the couple’s expressions.</p>
